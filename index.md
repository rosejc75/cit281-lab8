## Welcome to Rose's Lab 8
In this lab we focused on fastify 

### Fastify node-fetch package
We installed a fastify node-fetch package in the terminal. Using starter code given in lab, we edited to declalre a constant variable fastify, import fastify and execute the imported function.

### JSONPlaceholder data
We edited the code to add the route that will return photo data using a JSONPlaceholder photo adrdress and node-fetch. We used two different .then() methods and one .catch() to achieve this.
